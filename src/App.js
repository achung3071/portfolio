  I'm Andrew, a Computer Science major at Northwestern University. I
  do a lot of web development (mainly back-end engineering). I'm
  most comfortable with Express and Flask and have front-end
  experience in React and React Native — but I'm always down for a
  new challenge. You can find some of the projects I've worked on
  down below.
  <br />
  <br />
  I'm also the incoming Tech Studio Lead at Northwestern’s Develop +
  Innovate for Social Change and a peer mentor for CS 110
  (Introductory Python). Going forward, I hope to utilize my skills
  in technology to provide positive value to others around me and
  beyond.
